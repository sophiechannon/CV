I am a career changer Junior Software Engineer with a background the arts sector. I recently spent an amazing 16 weeks on the Makers Academy software engineering bootcamp learning to be a full stack engineer. In those 16 weeks I went from knowing some basic Ruby and JavaScript, to conceptualising and delivering a full stack, test driven, React website, using multiple APIs and working in a team. 

My career in the arts and charitable sectors so far has revolved around fundraising and relationship building. I loved working in the industry and doing work that helped people, however, as I learnt more about myself, I realised that I craved a career that would enable me to problem solve, apply logical and pragmatic thinking, and make cool things.

Outside of work, I am a musician and lead the viola section in the Cambridge Philharmonic Orchestra. I'm also really into running, stand up paddle boarding, and going on aimless rambles by myself. I practice yoga and meditation, and love being outdoors. I also run a small macrame tapestry business, [Macramazing](https://macramazing.co.uk)!

# Skills and strengths

### Quick learner
 I can typically understand a concept, or a framework well enough to get started with it very rapidly and then build upon my understanding and knowledge as I use it. For example, learning React and transforming the Acebook project into a dynamic website in just a few days.

### Problem solving
 I am good at breaking down a problem into smaller chunks and finding a clear path for navigating large and tricky problems. An example of this would be planning the Beach Finder project at Makers, where we used GitHub projects to develop a user story and split the task into manageable tickets.
 
 ### Teaching others
 I can be patient and enjoy sharing my knowledge with others, especially when those who are willing to learn. I find great satisfaction from helping somebody find a solution themselves.

### Persuasive communication skills
As a fundraising professional, I spent a lot of time speaking to people across all levels and industries to tell our story. By listening to businesses needs, I could find parts of our stories that overlapped, helping them to connect with us, and resulting in symbiotic partnerships.

### Project development and management
At Cambridge Junction, I honed my leadership skills whilst overseeing multiple projects from their inception, through all stages of fundraising and delivery, right through to evaluation and monitoring. It was my job to keep the delivery team on track and on budget, and to report back to the funder at the end. I applied this experience to my group work at Makers.
