## Skills

- **Project development and management**

In my most recent role, I had the opportunity to hone my leadership skills whilst overseeing multiple projects from their inception, through all stages of fundraising and delivery, right through to evaluation and monitoring. It was my job to keep the delivery team on track and on budget, and to report back to the funder at the end.

- **Teamwork**

I believe that everybody can bring something unique to a team and that combining skills together through effective teamwork is far more important than having a talented individual in a poorly managed team. One of my greatest examples of teamwork takes place outside of the workplace: playing in music ensembles. When I rehearse with orchestra, I need to listen very carefully to all of the other sections, follow the conductor unquestioningly, and blend my sound to match that of my peers in the viola section.

- **Streamlining processes**

I came into a team in a fairly junior level to help with fundraising administration. I spent the first six months digitising everything: setting up online membership sales, reducing the need for manual data entry, adding handwritten records onto the CRM, analysing donor behaviour through Excel instead of guessing. This freed me up to support my manager with actual income generating work, and together we doubled number of donors in two years and launched several successful campaigns.

- **Persuasive communication skills**

As a fundraising professional, I spent a lot of time speaking to people across all levels and industries to tell our story. By listening to businesses needs, I could find parts of our stories that overlapped, helping them to connect with us, and resulting in symbiotic partnerships.
