I am a fast learning software engineer with a background in the arts sector. I retrained in 16 weeks on the Makers Academy software engineering bootcamp. In those 16 weeks I went from knowing some basic Ruby and JavaScript, to conceptualising and delivering a full stack, test driven, React website in a small team.

I am working in my first tech role now as a junior full stack developer at a veterinary services company, helping to save animals.

**Skills I gained at Makers**
- **Pair programming:** working collaboratively with people with different learning styles

- **Test Driven Development:** trusting the TDD process to guide me towards a better and well tested result
- **Meaningful code review:** thoroughly reading and understanding other people's code before committing it to the main branch
- **Group project working:** finding a balance between getting work done and ensuring that everybody's ideas were included
- **Mentoring:** I was inspired by my own great mentor to take on two mentors who are currently studying at Makers. This has been very rewarding so far

# Skills and strengths

### Quick learner
 I can typically understand a concept, or a framework well enough to get started with it very rapidly and then build upon my understanding and knowledge as I use it. For example, learning React and transforming the Acebook project into a dynamic website in just a few days.

### Problem solving
 I am good at breaking down a problem into smaller chunks and finding a clear path for navigating large and tricky problems. An example of this would be planning the Beach Finder project at Makers, where we used GitHub projects to develop a user story and split the task into manageable tickets.
 
 ### Teaching others
 I can be patient and enjoy sharing my knowledge with others, especially when those who are willing to learn. I find great satisfaction from helping somebody find a solution themselves. I built upon my previous teaching experience during my time at Makers, espcially in group projects or pairing sessions.

### Project development and management
At Cambridge Junction, I honed my leadership skills whilst overseeing multiple projects from their inception, through all stages of fundraising and delivery, right through to evaluation and monitoring. It was my job to keep the delivery team on track and on budget, and to report back to the funder at the end. I applied this experience to my group work at Makers by carrying out frequent standups and retros.


# My career so far

### Associate Tutor in Concert Management
